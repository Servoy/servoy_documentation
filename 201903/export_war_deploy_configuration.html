When a WAR is deployed it will use the user.home dir of the user that runs the applicaiton server. <br/>
Here you can configure that it should use another directory so it doesn't depend on user.home <br/>
Also when you make changes on the admin page then the servoy.properties are saved in that dir.<br/>
And when you redeploy this new WAR, it will still use that properties file. With these settings you can tell it what it should use.
