<p>Wizard has detected the server is missing some DBI files that are present in local database. Having DBI file for each table helps keeping the database structure in sync among multiple developers using team provider. This means local database has some extra tables that are not present in DBI metadata representation. If a table doesn't have a DBI file Servoy will automatically generate one in memory, so not having one is not necessarily a bad thing. </p>
