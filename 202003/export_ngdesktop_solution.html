Create NgDesktop installer.<br>
Since version 2020.12 the autoupdate feature is supported. In order to use this feature an URL for future update files must be provided when creating the installer.<br>
Starting with the next NgDesktop version, when choose to generate the update, three files will be downloaded: the installer binary, the update binary and an yml file containing update details.
For the customers that already installed the NgDesktop application, you must place the update binary and the yml file to the URL location.
</p>
<p>
NgDesktop will detect the update, download it in the background and display a desktop notification. The update will be installed on the next restart.
