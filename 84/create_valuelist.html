<p>Create a valuelist if you would like to let end-users select one or more values from a list of values. And bind this to user controls which contain the "valuelist" property. A valuelist can be created in a number of ways.</p><p>Go to the "Valuelists" node into the Solution Explorer and do a right-click on it to create one. Or left-click on the icon in the detail panel below.</p><h2>Valuelist Name</h2><p>Here you can define a name for the valuelist.</p><h2>Custom values</h2><p>Here you can add your own static values. Each value on a new line will be treated as a separate value. You can make a list of single values but you can also make a separation between so-called "dispay values" and "real values". The former will be shown to the end-user and the latter will be physically returned into the data provider. The two values are separated by a "pipe" character (|).</p><h2>Global method</h2><p>From here you can generate a global method which Servoy triggers automatically to obtain data. Since this is your own code, the data can come from every source you like. But also be careful, because you have no control over when this code is executed. This makes it the least-performing option of all. Specifically for the NG Client the additional setting "Lazy loading" has been added to give you more control.</p><h2>Table values</h2><p>Values can also be obtained directly from an SQL table or view. Servoy will then take care of the initial retrieval and updates automatically. You only have to select a field for which the value will be physically returned (real value) and a value that is displayed to the end-user (display value).</p><p>In case you are using a dynamic table which holds values for different valuelists, there is an option called "Apply valuelist name as filter on column 'valuelist_name'". This allows you to have a single table with a column called "valuelist_name" on which Servoy will automatically apply a filter to, which will return the correct set of records to be used in the valuelist itself.</p><h2>Related values</h2><p>Instead of a table, you can also choose to select a relation which points to an SQL table or view. This can be very convenient if you want to filter your values based on another table or static values</p><h2>Definition</h2><p>If you chose to use table values or related values, then this is the place to define which data providers you would like to use for which purpose. They will be displayed in these three panels in which you can highlight one per panel. In each of the panels you can specify whether it should be considered a display value ("Show in field / list") and/or as a real value ("Return in dataprovider").</p><p>In case multiple display values are selected, you can use the "Separator character" to define how these values are separated.</p><h2>Deprecated</h2><p>If this existing valuelist should not be used anymore, you are able to deprecate it. By defining a documentation string, the valuelist will be automatically deprecated and that string will be used within documentation and code completion.</p><h2>Encapsulation</h2><p>Here you can specify where the valuelist should be available. If you select "Public" it will be available in all solutions and modules. If you select "Module Scope" then it will be available in this solution or module only.</p><h2>Fallback valuelist</h2><p>Sometimes you just want the end-user to select a limited amount of values. But if the record is being edited and the data provider contains a value which currently isn't selectable, then you can use a fallback valuelist. This valuelist could contain all possible values, so that Servoy is able to find the correct translation between the non-existing real value and its display value.</p><h2>Allow empty value</h2><p>Check this option if you would like the end-user to be able to select an empty value. In that case an additional empty entry will be added at the top of the list.</p><h2>Sorting definition</h2><p>In case you are using table values or related values, then you can specify the sort order in which the value are being displayed.</p>
