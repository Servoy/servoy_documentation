    This Wizard creates a Runtime Execution environment of Servoy which is package like a WAR (WebApplicationArchive). Which can be deployed on a standard java application server such as Tomcat<br/>
    You can also select if you want to export the current active solution with its modules (and other none active solutions besides the main) or to export a number of rows from all tables instead all rows.
    For the most part this does have the same export options as a Servoy solution export.<br/>
    In such a WAR you can also besides the active solution also import .servoy files through the admin page. This only works if these solutions or modules are not in the active solution set.
