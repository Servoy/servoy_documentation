<p>Create forms so end-users can interact with your application.</p><p>A form can be created by doing a right-click on the "Forms" node inside your solution. You can also do a left-click on that node and click the icon in the detail panel of the Solution Explorer.</p><h2>Form name</h2><p>Choose a form name that makes sense to you. Also be aware that the amount of forms can significantly grow over time.</p><h2>Datasource</h2><p>You can bind an SQL-based table (or view) to a form. By doing this, you can select its columns, calculations and aggregations as a "data provider" on form elements, so that record values are automatically displayed and synchronized between client and server.</p><h2>Extends</h2><p>Select another form if you want to extend (or inherit) properties of another form.</p><h2>Style</h2><p>Here you can select a stylesheet (from the resources) to style your form. Please note that this setting is only applicable to Smart Client and Web Client solutions.</p><h2>Template</h2><p>If you have created and stored a form template then you can use that here. All the properties that make up this template will be reused in this form.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>Choose the solution where you want to store your new form into. Please note that this setting will only be enabled if your active solution consists of more than one solution or module only.</p>
<h2>Working Set</h2><p>Choose an existing working set where you want your form to be added. The working set is a logical grouping of forms for better organization. A working set can be created from context menu of Forms node in Solution Explorer</p>
<h2>Type</h2><p>Form type specifies the User Interface of the form. Abstract form can only contain code, will be used for common functionality in form hierarchy. CSS Position is new form type in NGClient, uses css top,right,bottom,left,width, height attributes. Responsive form is more complex NGClient form which uses Bootstrap 12-grid layout(by default). Anchored form is the legacy form layout, similar to css position, where you specify location, size and to which of the four sides each element is anchored to.</p><p>Learn more on our Wiki <a href="https://wiki.servoy.com/display/DOCS/Creating+Forms" target="_blank">here</a></p>
