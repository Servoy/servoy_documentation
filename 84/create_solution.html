<p>Here you can create a brand new solution.</p><p>You can create one by doing a right-click on "All solutions" or by clicking the link below.</p><h2>Solution name</h2><p>Choose a name for your solution that makes sense. This name will also become part of the URL when accessing it from the browser.</p><h2>Solution type</h2><p>The solution type determines in which way you would like to use it.</p><p>Learn more on our Wiki <a href="https://wiki.servoy.com/display/DOCS/Creating+a+Solution" target="_blank">here</a></p><h2>Resources project</h2><p>You can choose whether your new solution or module will make use of the resources, such as database servers, styles and security. If you choose to do so, then it's highly recommended to have a single resources project inside your workspace. So if none exists yet, then it needs to be created and otherwise you should use the existing one.</p><p>In case you are creating a more dynamic module with utility methods, it is usually better to choose no resources module. This means that you are able to use it in other projects as well without the dependency on these particular resources.</p>
