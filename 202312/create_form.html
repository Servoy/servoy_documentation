<p>Create forms so end-users can interact with your application.</p>
<p>A form can be created with a right-click on the "Forms" node inside your solution. You can also do a left-click on that node and click the icon in the detail panel of the Solution Explorer.</p>
<h2>Form name</h2><p>Choose a form name that makes sense to you. Also be aware that the amount of forms can significantly grow over time.</p>
<h2>Datasource</h2><p>You can bind an SQL-based table (or view) to a form. You can use any table from defined servers (server is a connection to an SQL database or in mem database). By doing this, you can select its columns, calculations and aggregations as a "data provider" on form elements, so that record values are automatically displayed and synchronized between client and server.</p>
<h2>Extends</h2><p>Select another form if you want to extend (or inherit) properties of another form.</p>
<h2>Working Set</h2><p>Choose an existing working set where you want your form to be added. The working set is a logical grouping of forms for better organization. A working set can be created from context menu of Forms node in Solution Explorer</p>
<h2>Type</h2><p>Form type specifies the User Interface of the form. <a href="https://docs.servoy.com/guides/develop/application-design/forms/layout-management/abstract-form" target="_blank">Abstract form</a> can only contain code, will be used for common functionality in form hierarchy. <a href="https://docs.servoy.com/guides/develop/application-design/forms/layout-management/css-position" target="_blank">CSS Position</a> is the form type in NGClient, uses css top, right, bottom, left, width and height attributes. <a href="https://docs.servoy.com/guides/develop/application-design/forms/layout-management/home" target="_blank">Responsive form</a> is more complex NGClient form which uses Bootstrap 12-grid layout(by default).</p><p>Learn more on our Wiki <a href="https://wiki.servoy.com/display/DOCS/Creating+Forms" target="_blank">here</a></p>
