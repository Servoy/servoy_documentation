<p>Create a relation if you would like to bind two tables or views together. There are a number of ways to create a relation.</p><p>A relation can be created by going to the "Relations" node in one of your solutions and do a right-click on it. You can also do a left-click on that node and click the button in the detail panel below.</p>
<h2>Relation name</h2><p>You can define a name for your relation here. But if you keep this value default, Servoy will create it for you automatically as soon as you have defined its source and destination.</p>
<h2>Source and destination</h2><p>Here you can select a source and destination data source (table or view). By clicking on the button next to the name, you can select it from a list.</p>
<h2>Relation items</h2><p>Here you are able to define one or more relation items based on physical columns from the selected data sources.</p><p>At the source you are also able to select a global variable or directly typing a static value that relates to a destination data source column.</p><p>Per item you can speficy the operator like equals,greater or like, and an operator can have a modifier like <bold>or-is-null</bold> when it can also be null, <bold>case-insensitive</bold> search or <bold>remove-when-null</bold> then if the left side value is null (like a global variable) then this condition will be fully removed from the related query</p>
<h2>Join type</h2><p>The join type defines how the relation behaves when it cannot find any destination record based on the source record. Choose "left outer join" (which is the default) if the source record should be available to you no matter if a related record can be found. But choose "inner join" if you want those source records to be omitted in this particular case.</p>
<h2>Initial Sort</h2><p>If you would like the data from the relationship to be be sorted by default, then you can define that here. By clicking on the button next to it you are able to select multiple (related) columns to sort on.</p>
<h2>Deprecated</h2><p>If this existing relation should not be used anymore, you are able to deprecate it. By defining a documentation string, the relation will be automatically deprecated and that string will be used within documentation and code completion.</p>
<h2>Encapsulation</h2><p>In some cases you would like to restrict the usage of your relation, based in its purpose. By default, it is available throughout all of your solutions as its value is set to "Public". You can also make it available only for the solution or module you have created it in, by selecting "Module Scope". And if you select "Hiding in Scripting; Module Scope" then it will only be available in forms for the solution or module you have created it in.</p>
<h2>Allow creation of related records</h2><p>You can create records through a relation by default (in forms or scripting). However, if you would like to disallow this, you can uncheck this option. In that case you can only create records in a non-related foundset or through another relation which does allow this.</p>
<h2>Allow parent delete when having related records</h2><p>If you want to be sure that a parent record cannot be deleted when it has related child records (which would result in orphan records), then you can enable this option.</p>
<h2>Delete related records</h2><p>Servoy can also automatically delete child records in a cascading style, when the parent is deleted. Please note that this can be a dangerous setting, which should be treated with care.</p>
