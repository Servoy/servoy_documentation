<p>Here you can create a brand new solution.</p><p>The solution (Eclipse project) contains User Interface screens (forms) and code you want to run into your application.</p><h2>Solution name</h2><p>Choose a name for your solution that makes sense. This name will also become part of the URL when accessing it from the browser.</p>
    <h2>Configure solution</h2>
    <p>
        Enhance your solution with auto-installed modules for:
        <ul>
            <li><b>security</b> - to support login/authentication</li>
            <li><b>search</b> - which provides search API for text-based, user-interactive searching</li>
            <li><b>utils</b> - which is a wide range of low-level utility methods and application concepts for Servoy solutions</li>
            <li><b>navigation</b> - provides ready to use single page navigation templates; is also extensible to allow for custom UI and even other UX patterns</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br/><h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
    <h2>Solution type</h2><p>The solution type determines whether solution should run as application (in ng client, ng module (for ng ui module), module a utility solution which contains common functionality, service for headless client/batch processor/web service provider) or a special pre or post import module that contains code to be execute at import (import solution).</p>

    <h2>Location</h2><p>By default the solution project will be created in the folder of the current workspace. You can also create the solution in a different location, such as your git folder.</p>
    <h2>Resources project</h2><p>You can choose whether your new solution or module will make use of the resources, such as database servers, styles and security. If you choose to do so, then it's highly recommended to have a single resources project inside your workspace. So if none exists yet, then it needs to be created and otherwise you should use the existing one.</p><p>In case you are creating a more dynamic module with utility methods, it is usually better to choose no resources module. This means that you are able to use it in other projects as well without the dependency on these particular resources.</p>
<h2>Less theme</h2><p>NG Client solutions can use direct css styling or less styling (Leaner Style Sheets). See more about how to use Less with NGClient <a href='https://wiki.servoy.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=31752222' target="_blank">here</a></p>
