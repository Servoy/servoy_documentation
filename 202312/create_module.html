<p>Here you can create a new module for your solution.</p><p>The module (Eclipse project) contains User Interface screens (forms) and code you want to run into your application.</p><h2>Solution name</h2><p>Choose a name for your module that makes sense.</p>
	<br/><h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
	<h2>Solution type</h2><p>The solution type determines whether your module is a utility solution which contains common functionality with UI (<bold>NG Module</bold>) or without ui (<bold>Module</bold>), code to be execute at import (<bold>pre</bold> or <bold>post import</p>bold> module) or authentication code through a <bold>authenticator</bold> module.</p>

	<h2>Location</h2><p>By default the module project will be created in the folder of the current workspace. You can also create the module in a different location, such as your git folder.</p>
	<h2>Resources project</h2><p>You can choose whether your new module will make use of the resources, such as database servers, styles and security. You can choose to have the same resources project as the main solution or no resource project.</p><p>In case you are creating a more dynamic module with utility methods, it is usually better to choose no resources module. This means that you are able to use it in other projects as well without the dependency on these particular resources.</p>
